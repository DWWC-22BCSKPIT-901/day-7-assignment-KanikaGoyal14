# DAY 7

## Questions :  
• You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist. Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.  
• You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination. Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.  
• Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.  
• You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island. Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.  
• You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
